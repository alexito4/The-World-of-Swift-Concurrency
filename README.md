# Swift Concurrency

This repository contains all the expirements I've been doing with Swift Concurrency. 

> Note that most of the expriments use Swift's development snapshoots and not the official versions that come with Xcode 13 betas. This is mainly due to the fact that I was working on this before WWDC and that beta 1 has old APIs.

## What is this?

As you may know I've been following Swift Concurrency development almost since the begining. I've also been experimenting with the features with Swift's snapshoots and that's what this repo contains.

You can read [The World of Swift Concurrency](https://alejandromp.com/swift-concurrency) on my website, where I'm writting everything I know about this topic.
